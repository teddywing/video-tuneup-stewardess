# Video Tuneup Stewardess
Stewardess is the backend webservice for the [Video Tuneup](https://github.com/bcjordan/Video-Tuneup) iPad app.

Stewardess takes your order (a music file plus some parameters) and hands it off to the bartender (who shakes it all up). When he's done, she gives you the result, fresh, fizzy, and delicious.
